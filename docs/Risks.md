# Risks

This file will be part of the project management document.

* Sickness me/supervisor
* Project plan is bad
* other Ideas


## Human Riscs

* Sickness - There is a possibility that I may become sick. If the sickness is less than 1 Week, there is a Buffer in the project plan at the end of the semester for that. If its more than 1 Week, there is a chance that the Project would need to be moved to an other semester. Possiblity: Medium

* Broken Hardware - There is a possibility that the Hardware used (Laptop) may break due to unknown reasons. The Deliverables are backed u to github and mirrored to the BFH-TI Gitlab. There is also a Backup on other Hardware. There also Backup Hardware if the main Hardware would break. Possibility: Low.

* Not accessible Backups - There is the possibility that the Backups are not accessible. For that case there is a also a Backup on different Devices. Possibility Low.

* Bad Project Plan - There is the possibility that the project plan is bad, so that the Planned time frames are to short. In that case there is 1 week buffer at the end of the semester. If that is not enough time, then there needs to be an explanation in the documentation why that happend. Possibility: Medium.

* Outside Ideas - There is the possibility that the expert of the project may bring new Ideas into the project. If those ideas further the projects goals, they may be added to the project plan. In that case the Project plan needs to be reworked. Possibility: Low.


## VCs

1. There is the possibility that the structure of VCs breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the stucture of VCs needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possiblity: Low

## OIDC4VC

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of OIDC4VC leaks data. If that is the case, the structure of the OIDC4VC protocol needs to be reworked so there are no more data leaks. Possibility: Low

2. There is the possibility that the implementation of OIDC4VC breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the structure of the OIDC4VC protocol needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Medium

## Psuedonyms

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of Pseudonyms breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the structure of Pseudonyms needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Low


## Link Secrets

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of Link Secrets breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the implementation of the Link Secrets needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Middle

2. There is the possibility that the implementation of Link Secrets allows the holder of multiple VCs to Link the together on a different Secret. If that is the case, the implemetation of the Link Secrets needs to be reworked so that this os no longer possible: Possibility: High
